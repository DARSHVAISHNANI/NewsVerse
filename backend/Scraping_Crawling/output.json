    "content": "A former Australian politicianconvicted of sexually abusing two young menhe met through work has been sentenced to five years and nine months in jail. Gareth Ward, 44, has been in prison since July after a jury found him guilty of raping one man and indecently assaulting another, in separate incidents in 2013 and 2015. Ward represented the coastal town of Kiama in the New South Wales (NSW) parliament from 2011. He resigned as a Liberal Party minister when the claims emerged in 2021 but refused to quit parliament and was re-elected in 2023. Judge Kara Shead SC considered Ward's disability of legal blindness in her sentence and found \"no other penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate\". Ward, who appeared via video-link at Parramatta District Court, will serve at least three years and nine months in prison before he can apply for parole. Justice Shead said the court needs to \"send a stern message to like-minded offenders that sexual offendings such as this will be met with salutary penalties\". She also said Ward had \"escaped justice for a decade and enjoyed a life free from a programme or punishment for his crimes during that time\". Shead described his actions as \"callous and predatory\" and rejected arguments by Ward that his public fall from grace amounted to extra-curial punishment - disadvantages suffered by the offender but not imposed by the court - because it was \"inevitable\" that his crimes would attract media attention. After his conviction in July, Ward launchd a failed legal bid to remain in parliament andresigned moments before the members could expel him. His legal team has previously said he intends to appeal the guilty verdict. Ward's nine-week trial in the NSW District Court heard that he invited a drunk 18-year-old man to his home in 2013 and indecently assaulted him three times, despite his attempts to resist. Two years later, he raped a 24-year-old political staffer at his home after an event at parliament. In a victim impact statement, the then 18-year-old described how he turned to drugs and alcohol to cope after the assault and said he suffered frequent flashbacks. The then 24-year-old also described using alcohol as a form of self-medication and said the abuse had destroyed his dream of entering politics. Ward had argued the 2015 rape didn't happen, and that the other complainant was misremembering their encounter from 2013. But the prosecution argued that striking similarities in the accounts of the two men, who did not know each other, showed they were telling the truth. A jury deliberated for three days before returning the guilty verdicts. On Friday the judge noted that Ward had shown no remorse as he maintained his innocence but nevertheless said he had good prospects for rehabilitation. Ward's resignation prompted a by-election in Kiama in September, which was won by the Labor candidate.",

    "title": "Australian influencer family move to UK to avoid social media ban",
    "date": "2025-10-31",
    "time": "04:23:07",
    "content": "An Australian family with millions of online fans are relocating to the UK to avoid their home country's social media ban for under-16s which starts in December. Known as the \"Empire Family\", the four-member unit is made of mums Beck and Bec Lea, 17-year-old son Prezley and daughter Charlotte, 14, who all post videos of their daily lives. In a post, the family said they use the internet \"for good\" and the move to the UK will mean their daughter can continue to make content. Australia's ban - touted as a world-first - will mean Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent those under 16 years from creating accounts and deactivate existing ones. The ban is designed to protect young people from the harmful impact of social media and tech companies that do not comply risk being fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m). It is unclear how they will implement the ban but some potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology, prompting concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software. YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but earlier this year the government reversed its decision. Teens under 16 will still be able to view videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform. In the video detailing the family's decision to move from Perth in Western Australia to London, Beck says they are not against the social media ban. \"We understand that it is protecting young people from harm on the internet but we use the internet for good,\" she said. \"We understand that there's young people that are affected negatively from social media, we're not naïve to that.\" Her concerns are that the government hasn't \"defined it exactly, of how it's going to work yet\". \"It covers us while Australia figures out the logistics of that rule because I think there's going to be a lot of hiccups and a lot of ups and downs.\" Beck's wife Bec said social media had changed so much since it first emerged and many young people were \"making a difference for good\" on platforms. The move also came about as all the family have dual British-Australian citizenship and their daughter Charlotte recently decided to switch to online schooling, meaning they can be based anywhere. Charlotte, who posts online as Charli, has about half a million YouTube followers, about 300,000 fans on TikTok and almost 200,000 on Instagram. Her accounts are managed by her parents. The family's main presence is on YouTube with son Prezley's account attracting 2.8 million subscribers while the family's account is followed by 1.8 million. The videos include make-up tutorials, gaming sessions and family holidays.",

    "title": "Behind the Powai tragedy: Rohit Arya’s long fight with Maharashtra’s School Education Dept",
    "date": "2025-10-31",
    "time": "22:17:04",
    "content": "Rohit Arya, who was killed by the police in Powai on Thursday ending a hostage crisis, had a long and complicated association with the Maharashtra government. What began in 2022 as a collaboration with the state School Education Department to promote cleanliness through his “Swachhata Monitor” initiative gradually spiralled into a bitter dispute over unpaid funds, allegations of corruption, and a series of protests that marked Arya’s final days before he was shot by the police in a Powai acting studio, where he was holding 17 children hostage. Early days A banker-turned-social entrepreneur and filmmaker, Arya, who originally hailed fromPune, launched Project Let’s Change in October 2013 “to establish necessity for a change in way things are done or are perceived,” as mentioned on his website. The initiative began with the making of a film titled ‘Let’s Change’, written and directed by Arya, inspired by the campaign ‘Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti Se Sardar Patel Jayanti Tak’ in 2013. The film was later screened in schools across Maharashtra and Gujarat to motivate students to take up cleanliness drives with actionable plans. As part of the project, he had launched the concept of Swachhata Monitor, an initiative appointing schoolchildren as cleanliness ambassadors for their schools and neighbourhoods. Activities under the programme included spotting and discouraging acts such as littering and spitting, and documenting such incidents on video to raise awareness. According to Arya’s official website, the concept had “two benefits: children were made proactive to take action and adults were more likely to listen to children ensuring greater results toward achieving cleanliness by creating a community of monitors, as opposed to conventional cleanliness campaigns involving individualised and limited activities.” Collaboration with the state In September 2022, Arya approached the School Education Department with the Swachhata Monitor concept. He was granted permission to implement it in select schools, on the condition that he would raise funds through CSR or other means. Arya ran the project in 2022 at his own expense before submitting a fresh proposal in 2023 to expand its scope. The government approved the proposal through a Government Resolution (GR) dated June 30, 2023, and disbursed Rs 9.9 lakh to Arya’s company. Phase I of Swachhata Monitor, conducted between July and October 2023, reportedly involved 64,000 schools and over 59 lakh students. The programme included screenings of the ‘Let’s Change’ film and workshops for students and teachers on effectively implementing cleanliness activities. Merger with a larger state programme According to another GR dated January 25, 2024, Swachhata Monitor was later merged with the state’s broader school beautification initiative, Mazi Shala Sundar Shala (My School, Beautiful School), a competition encouraging schools to improve their campuses through cleanliness drives, gardens, and other beautification measures. The GR stated that Swachhata Monitor (Phase II) would form one of the parameters used to evaluate schools under Mazi Shala Sundar Shala. It also earmarked Rs 20.63 crore for the larger programme and Rs 2 crore within that for Swachhata Monitor (Phase II). Arya was named Project Director for the second phase, continuing his role from Phase I. Funding dispute and fallout The fallout between Arya and the department began soon after. Arya alleged that the government never released the Rs 2 crore promised for Phase II. However, the department, in a statement issued Thursday, said the funds were withheld due to an “unacceptable proposal” from Arya regarding implementation plans. “The agreement involved various responsibilities on his company’s part such as conducting training workshops, holding events, showing film among others. But the invoice submitted by Arya was unacceptable as it lacked proper details on activities conducted under the initiative. He was asked to resubmit the proposal with complete details. Meanwhile, it was revealed that Arya had collected registration fees from schools for the Swachhata Monitor initiative, without having any approval for it from the government,” said a senior department official on condition of anonymity. A clarification note issued by the School Education Department on Thursday stated that following this revelation, a letter dated August 23, 2024, from the Commissioner of Education directed that Apsara Media Entertainment Network should deposit any money collected from schools into a government account and provide a written undertaking not to collect fees in the future. “Upon completion of the two conditions Apsara Media Entertainment Network was allowed to submit a fresh proposal for implementation of Swachhata Monitor 2024-25. However, since the required information from Rohit Arya was not received, further action on the matter could not be taken,” the note stated. Arya’s claims and protests In interactions with local media in October 2024, Arya alleged that there had been no progress from the department on taking his initiative forward. Consequently, he began running Swachhata Monitor privately and started collecting registration fees of Rs 500 per school, which he said was necessary in the absence of government support. Arya claimed that this became another reason for the delay in fund disbursement, as the department launched an inquiry against him. He told the media that he planned to refund the collected money if the government resumed support, a statement also reflected on his initiative’s website. Arya’s death has now put renewed focus on the events of the past year, during which he accused the department of not only withholding dues but also “robbing” his concept and sidelining him to favour certain schools in Mazi Shala Sundar Shala awards. From August 2024, Arya held multiple protests, including hunger strikes and sit-ins, outside the School Education Commissionerate in Pune and at the official residence of then School Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar inMumbai. During one such protest in October 2024, Arya told local media that Kesarkar had personally issued him a cheque of a “substantial amount” with an assurance of repayment once government funds were released. The Kesarkar funding issue Kesarkar’s decision to issue a personal cheque in February 2024 has drawn attention, raising questions over why a minister would personally assist a private contractor awaiting official dues. Kesarkar, however, said that it was out of compassion. “He was in a difficult situation financially so I helped him out of compassion. But to receive government funding for his project, he had to comply with all the requirements. He was unable to understand the fact that just because Rs 2 crore budgetary allocation is made for the project; it will not be just handed out. He had to submit all the invoices, vouchers and required documents to support the expenses. I did try to resolve his issue by helping him understand the process too. But then it was revealed that he charged fees to schools on his own, which was inappropriate,” said Kesarkar, who further added that his eventual act of holding children hostage was completely unacceptable as children’s safety is of utmost importance. In an interview with a Pune-based media outlet in October 2024, Arya had also alleged irregularities and favouritism in the Mazi Shala Sundar Shala awards. “When I started taking objection to these activities, they started to target me. When I objected to the discrepancies in implementation of Swachhata Monitor under Mazi Shala Sundar Shala initiative to favour certain schools to win prizes, the department started to sideline me and the delay in fund allocation began,” Arya alleged. Wider questions over school initiatives Arya’s death has put a question mark on how extracurricular programmes are handled in schools across Maharashtra. “At this moment there are at least 6-7 such extra-curricular initiatives being conducted in schools,” said a teacher. Some of these include Mission Life Eco Club, Vikasit Bharat Buildothon, Veer Gatha 5.0, and Ek Ped Ma Ke Naam. The teacher said, “There is no way of knowing if all of them have a private agency attached to it, just like Arya’s. These agreements are not always public knowledge as it is essentially a government-run project.” According to educators, it is common practice for independent organisations to propose concepts to the government, which are then expanded statewide. A senior department official clarified that not all such initiatives rely on private entities. “No private agency can ensure a large-scale implementation of any project, without government support. Sometimes concepts are introduced by private agencies, but the state assures implementation with a network of schools.” Teachers’ associations across Maharashtra have consistently opposed the proliferation of such initiatives, citing the growing non-academic workload. “The opposition essentially has been due to increasing non-academic task burdens on teachers. But Arya’s death has definitely opened a different side of the issue of the long list of extra-curricular initiatives being burdened on schools across state, despite complaints raised by many of unnecessary overload of such campaigns,” said another teacher.",

    "content": "US Vice President JD Vance on Friday defended hisremarks about his wife, Usha Vance's Hindu faith, saying she is \"not a Christian and has no plans to convert,\" while rejecting criticism that he had \"thrown her religion under the bus in public\". In a strongly worded post on X, Vance called the backlash against his comments \"disgusting\" and accused his critics of \"anti-Christian bigotry\". \"What a disgusting comment, and it's hardly been the only one along these lines,\" Vance wrote, responding to social media users who accused him of disrespecting his wife's religion. \"First off, the question was from a person seemingly to my left, about my interfaith marriage. I'm a public figure, and people are curious, and I wasn't going to avoid the question.\" The Vice President's response followed intense criticism over his recent remarks at a university event, where he said he hoped his wife, Usha, might one day share his Christian faith. His comments, made while noting that she often attends church with him and their children, who are being raised Christian, drew backlash online for being dismissive of her Hindu background. Speaking at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the vice president had said he hoped his wife, Usha, who was raised Hindu, would one day embrace Christianity. \"Most Sundays she will come with me to church. Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that,\" he had said. Asked during the event whether he hoped his wife would eventually \"come to Christ\", Vance replied that faith was deeply personal and that differences in beliefhad never created conflict in their marriage. \"But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love,\" he said. Following the backlash, Vance took to social media to elaborate on his comments. \"She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage, or any interfaith relationship, I hope she may one day see things as I do,\" he wrote. \"Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,\" he added. He also defended his decision to address the question publicly, noting that as a national figure, he could not simply dismiss questions about his family. \"I'm a public figure, and people are curious, and I wasn't going to avoid the question,\" he wrote. The Vice President's response followed intense online criticism from commentators who said his remarks were insensitive to his wife's Hindu background. His clarification emphasised that it was Usha who had inspired him to reconnect with his Christian faith years ago. \"My wife, as I said at the TPUSA, is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to reengage with my faith many years ago,\" Vance said. He went on to condemn what he described as growing prejudice against Christians. \"Posts like this wreak anti-Christian bigotry,\" he wrote. \"Yes, Christians have beliefs. And yes, those beliefs have many consequences, one of which is that we want to share them with other people. That is a completely normal thing, and anyone who's telling you otherwise has an agenda.\" Vance and his wife, Usha, who is of Indian origin, met at Yale Law School and have two children together.- EndsPublished By:Nakul AhujaPublished On:Oct 31, 2025Tune InMust Watch",

    "date": "2021-06-14",
    "time": "22:46:00",
    "content": "Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan failed to meet Pashupati Kumar Paras at his house in New Delhi. NEW DELHI: In a surprise turn of events, Chirag Paswan , the president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan , was on Monday unceremoniusly unseated as the leader of the party in Lok Sabha. Chirag, who took over the mantle of the party in 2020 after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, stood completely isolated at the top within his party. Top Picks For You Pashupati Kumar Paras ousts Chirag Paswan as LJP leader in Lok Sabha: Key developments Five of the six members of Parliament of the LJP revolted against Chirag in an overnight coup and elected Pashupati Kumar Paras, his uncle, as the new leader of the party in Lok Sabha. Besides Pashupati Paras, the rebel group includes Chirag's cousin Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser. The group has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to inform him about the changes in the party. In the coming days, the rebels may stake claim in the Election Commission to represent the real LJP and could also move to oust Chirag from the top party post. 'You reap what you sow' Nitish Kumar 's party, the Janta Dal (United), reacted with a sense of vindication to the deveopments within the LJP. Chirag had led an aggressive anti-Nitish Kumar campaign in the 2020 assembly elections and in the process dealt a heavy political blow to the ruling Janta Dal (United) in Bihar . Chirag walked out of the NDA in the state and contested the assembly elections against Nitish Kumar's party. He fielded nominees, some of them BJP rebels, against all the JD(U) candidates. As a result, the JD(U) ended up losing several seats due to triangular contest and for the first time it became the junior partner to the BJP in Bihar NDA. Little wonder, Nitish Kumar's party reacted with a dig at the developments within the LJP. \"You reap what you sow,\" said JD(U)national president RCP Singh as he blamed Chirag for doing negative politics. \"Chirag Paswan has committed so many blunders in the recent past. The people of Bihar and his own party workers and leaders were not happy with whatever he did during the Bihar assembly election. Now, it's results are coming in the form of a split in the party,\" Singh said. Given the bitter political rivalry between the two parties since the 2020 assembly elections, sources close to Chirag Paswan accused the JD(U) for the split in the LJP. The JD(U), on the other hand, blamed Chirag Paswan's negative politics for the rift within his party. The lone LJP MLA in the Bihar assembly has already left the party to join the JD(U). Chirag tries to meet Paras, but fails As the events unfolded on Monday, Chirag Paswan drove to his uncle's residence in the national capital to meet him and Prince Raj. Paswan, who has not been keeping well for some time, waited for over 20 minutes in his car before he was let into the house and then left after spending more than an hour inside. He left without saying a word to waiting media persons. It is believed that neither of the two rebel MPs met him. A household help said the two were not at home when the LJP chief arrived. How will the BJP react? It would be interesting to see as to how the BJP reacts to the latest developments in this game of one-upmanship between the JD(U) and the LJP in Bihar. Chirag Paswan has all along kept a very strong pro-BJP and pro-PM Modi stand and announced ahead of assembly elections that he is working for a BJP government in Bihar. Pashupati Paras, on the other hand, is percieved as pro-Nitish Kumar. Paras today lauded Nitish Kumar as a good leader and \"vikas purush\" (development-oriented man). With talks of Union Cabinet reshuffle, it would be interesting to see if the BJP decides to include Chirag Paswan to ensure that he is not completely marginalised within his own party. The JD(U) has declined to comment on speculations about one or more rebel LJP MPs being inducted into the Union cabinet from the party quota or getting accommodated in the state ministry. However, it has reiterated the party stand that all NDA allies ought to get a \"respectable\" share at the Centre. 'I have saved the party' Pashupati Paras, who is an MP from Hajipur, a seat represented by Ram Vilas Paswan for several years, caimed that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the leadership of Chirag Paswan in Bihar. \"There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I have not broken the party. I have saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,\" Paras said when asked about the developments. Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA, and added that Paswan can remain in the organisation. Regarding the rumours that LJP will be joining the Janta Dal (United) in Bihar, the Hajipur MP said, \"Existence of LJP will continue, we are not joining JDU. We will fulfill the ambition of Late Ramvilas Paswan.\"",

    "content": "NEW DELHI: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government over the death of a journalist, who had recently run a story on the liquor mafia and was killed in what police said was a road accident. The Congress general secretary accused the Yogi Adityanath dispensation of \"nurturing jungle raj\". The 42-year-old news channel reporter, Sulabh Srivastava, died as his motorcycle rammed a pole near a brick kiln in Sukhpal Nagar under the Kotwali police station area of Pratapgarh on Sunday, police said. \"The liquor mafia from Aligarh to Pratapgarh: has caused death throughout the state. The government is silent,\" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. \"Journalists uncover the truth, warn the administration about the dangers. The government is asleep,\" she alleged. Does the government that is \"nurturing jungle raj\" have any answers for the tears of the family of journalist Sulabh Srivastava, Priyanka Gandhi asked. Srivastava had recently run a news story against the liquor mafia in the region. Then on June 12, he wrote to the Prayagraj additional director general of police to seek protection. Additional Superintendent of Police Surendra Dwivedi said Srivastava died in a crash while returning from Asrahi village under the Lalganj police station area after reporting on an illegal arms manufacturing unit uncovered there. Following the crash, a severely injured Srivastava was taken to the district hospital, where doctors declared him dead, he said.",
