    "title": "Bowen: Momentum is the strength of Trump's Gaza plan, but lack of detail is its weakness",
    "date": "2025-09-30",
    "time": "16:15:13",
    "content": "Donald Trump's framework agreement for ending the Gaza war and reconstructing the devastated territory has momentum behind it. Much of it comes from the president himself. Momentum comes too from leading Arab and Islamic countries who have supported the plan, including Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing next to Donald Trump, accepted it too, despite the fact it contains talk of a pathway to a Palestinian state that he has repeatedly denounced. To keep the pace up, Trump says that Hamas has \"three to four days\" to decide whether to say yes or no. If the answer is no, the war goes on. The proposed deal looks a lot like a plan put forward by Joe Biden well over a year ago. Since then there has been massive killing of Palestinian civilians, more destruction in Gaza, and now a famine, while Israeli hostages in Gaza have had to endure months more of agony and captivity. There were many reports in the Israeli media that the Biden initiative failed because Netanyahu moved the goalposts with a new set of demands - under pressure from the hard right in his cabinet. Even so, the framework plan is a significant moment. For the first time, Donald Trump is putting pressure on Israel to end the war. Donald Trump has made himself into a leader to whom it is hard to say no. Nobody wants to end up getting the roasting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office back in February. But things can change when leaders leave the White House. Before Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington DC to go back to Israel his staff filmed him putting over his version of events. One element was the idea of an independent Palestine next to Israel, the two-state solution which the UK and other Western countries have tried to revive by recognising Palestine. The Trump document gives an indeterminate nod to the idea of Palestinian independence. It says that after the reform of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in Ramallah and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, conditions \"may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\" Even the thought of a distant prospect of a Palestinian state was too much for Netanyahu, who had given whole-hearted support to Trump at the White House, telling him in English \"I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims.\" On the video, getting his message out in Hebrew to the people back home before the long flight home, Netanyahu is asked if he agreed to a Palestinian state. He was emphatic. \"No, absolutely not. It's not even written in the agreement. But we did say one thing. That we would forcibly resist a Palestinian state.\" Trump, he said, agreed. Momentum is the plan's strength. Its weakness is the lack of detail, a characteristic of Trumpian diplomacy. The document that Trump and Netanyahu endorsed, which also has the support of the UK and other European countries, comes with a rough map of stages of an IDF pull-back, but none of the nuts and bolts that determine whether diplomatic agreements designed to end a war hold together or disintegrate. If it is to work, hard negotiation will be necessary. In that process there will be many opportunities for it to break down. Mainstream opposition parties in Israel have endorsed the plan. It has been condemned by the extremist ultra-nationalists in the Netanyahu coalition, who had loved the \"Trump Riviera\" plan mooted at the start of the year, launched with a bizarre video showing the leaders of Israel and the US in beach gear sipping cocktails to the backdrop of a new Gazan cityscape glittering glass towers. The Israeli hard right were delighted that the Riviera plan included the removal of all of Gaza's more than two million Palestinians. Jewish extremists want the land annexed and Palestinians replaced with Jewish settlers. The new plan says no Palestinian will be forced to leave. Bezalel Smotrich, the ultranationalist finance minister and settler leader, compared it to the Munich agreement, signed this week in 1938. At Munich the UK and France forced Czechoslovakia to surrender territory and not long after its independence to Nazi Germany. If Hamas accepts the agreement, and if Benjamin Netanyahu wants to find ways to placate Smotrich and the other extremists who keep his coalition in power, he will have plenty of chances to sabotage the negotiations in ways that put the blame on Hamas. The structure of the Trump framework agreement allows Israel a range of opportunities to veto moves it does not like. It may not be possible to end a deep-seated conflict that has lasted more than a century. Longer term, the UK and many countries outside Israel and the US believe that any attempted solution that does not lead to Palestinian independence will not bring peace. When the foreign ministers of the Arab and Islamic countries issued their statement of support, they said that they believed it would lead to a full Israeli withdrawal and rebuilding of Gaza, and \"a path for just peace on basis of two-state solution under which Gaza is fully integrated with the West Bank in Palestinian state in accordance with international law.\" That could be taken as a coded reference to the decision of the International Court of Justice that the occupation of Palestinian land by Israel is illegal. Netanyahu believes the deal takes him closer to Israel's elusive victory over Hamas. He denies any Palestinian right to the land between the river Jordan and the sea. One plan, two very different versions of what it means. The framework is ambiguous enough for both interpretations to be possible. That is not a promising start.",

    "time": "00:33:32",
    "content": "In protest, Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) representative and ex-officio Ashish Shelar exited Wednesday’s Asian Cricket Council (ACC) online meeting midway after he failed to get clarity on when India would get the Asia Cup trophy and the players’ medals they won after beating Pakistan in the final on Sunday. Those in the know share that the Indian officials had questioned the ACC president and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi on this issue but he failed to give them a satisfactory reply. “Shelar informed members that the BCCI secretary Devajit Sakia has already written to ACC about the same but there has been no response. The BCCI wants the trophy and medals to be delivered to ACC’s office in Dubai from where the Indian board will get it collected. However, Shelar didn’t get a positive response for the same. So Shelar and Shukla decided to quit the meeting marking their protest,” a top BCCI official toldThe Indian Express. He also went on to add that Naqvi, in his opening speech, didn’t extend his congratulations to the Indian officials for winning the title. The meeting took place days after thebizarre sequence of events at the end of a tournamentin which the Indian captainSuryakumar Yadavrefused to shake hands with his Pakistan counter Salman Agha at the toss. During the final post-match presentation, the Indian team had refused to receive the trophy from Naqvi, who in turn didn’t agree to India’s demand. A day after the final, Suryakumar had summed up the scenes that played out in Dubai on Sunday.In a chat withThe Indian Express, he said that players didn’t go inside the dressing room and were waiting outside to collect the trophy. According to him, the Indian players waited for nearly an hour after they refused to receive the trophy from Naqvi, who is also his country’s interior minister. “We didn’t close the door and sit inside the dressing room. We didn’t make anyone wait for the presentation ceremony.Trophy leke bhaag gaye woh(They ran away with the trophy). That’s what I saw. I don’t know, some people were making a video of us, but we were standing. We didn’t go inside,” the 34-year-old said.",

    "title": "No flying school in India gets A+ or A in DGCA's first ever ranking",
    "date": "2025-10-01",
    "time": "00:38:00",
    "content": "Representative image NEW DELHI: No flying training organisation (FTO) in India has been placed in the top A+ or A category in the first ever ranking done of flying schools here by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. This ranking — a brainchild of DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai — was to start from Oct 1 and the regulator made the list public on Tuesday. Based on multiple parametres like safety record and time taken to complete required flying to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL), these two categories require a score of 70% and above. Thirteen FTOs have found a place in the B category — with scores between 50% and 70%. These include Chimes Aviation Academy, SVKM's NMIMS Academy of Aviation Shirpur, Bihar Flying Club, Orient Flights Aviation Academy, Skynex Aero, FSTC Flying School, Patiala Aviation Club, Haryana Institute of Civil Aviation, Jet Serve Aviation, Nagpur Flying Club, National Flying Training Institute, Banasthali Vidyapith Gliding & Flying Club and Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology. Twenty-two FTOs have been placed in the C category, which is for those with score below 50%. DGCA sends them “a notice for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.” Govt-owned Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) which comes under the Union aviation ministry also falls in this category. This is the first time FTOs have been ranked in India. “The idea is to improve FTOs in terms of both safety record and making them student-friendly. There will be lot of churn and improvement among the schools to either improve or retain their ranking — and become attractive enough for students. We hope to see some FTOs in A category next time,” said sources. FTO ranking will be published bi-annually, “preferably on October 1and April 1 of every year.” FTOs scoring 85% and above will be ranked A++; 70-84.99% as A+; 50%-69.99% A and below 50% as B. “Category ‘B’ FTOs will receive a notice from DGCA for self-analysis towards improvement of their performance.” FTOs are being ranked on several key parameters like safety record and time taken to complete 200 hours of flying — which is among the things required to earn commercial pilot licence (CPL). This will help budding pilots help choose “good” schools. Currently even after paying several lakhs, they have to virtually “beg” to get their flying hours at a majority of the schools. Through ranking, Govt wanted FTOs to improve on all counts, with safety being key along with timely completion of flying, in order to get better rankings and therefore attract students. While being a regulated sector, a majority of FTOs in India are anything but student-friendly and that forces large number of budding pilots to go abroad every year to earn their CPLs. “This is part of DGCA’s continued commitment to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of pilot training in India, while fostering a performance-driven and transparent training ecosystem. (Ranking) holds FTOs accountable for maintaining regulatory compliance and operational standards. Aspiring pilots and their families often struggle to identify credible FTOs. A ranking system serves as a reliable guide, helping them choose institutions based on quality, safety, and training outcomes rather than mere location or fees,” the regulator says. Apart from these actors, the DGCA sees ranking system will “ensure training quality and standardisation; enhance transparency and accountability; guidance for student pilots; aid in identifying high-performing FTOs for expansion or international collaboration, and underperforming ones for closer monitoring or corrective action.” All FTOs will have to submit performance data within the stipulated timelines for the scoring to be done in time. “DGCA reserves the right to verify submitted data through audits and inspections. Misreporting or non-compliance may adversely affect ranking and may invite regulatory action. FTO Ranking System serves the dual purpose of protecting student interests and ensuring a pipeline of quality trained pilots essential for the safe and sustainable growth the aviation sector in India,” the DGCA says.",
