The Republicans were searching for a candidate who could win back the presidency after Barack Obama's two terms in office.\nTrump strode off the debate stage in a glitzy Las Vegas hotel and into a room packed with cameras.\nJostling for position, I asked the man with the long red tie a couple of questions and, after boasting about his status as frontrunner in the race, he told me he had a message for the UK.\nThis will make news, I thought. Maybe something about immigration, Trump's signature campaign topic?\nIt was not. Instead Trump wanted BBC viewers to know that he had some fine golf courses on Scotland's shores which they should visit.\nThe answer struck me as remarkable for a man aspiring to become the so-called leader of the free world.\nGetty Images\nDonald Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, grew up on the Isle of Lewis before emigrating to America\nOf course Trump does have a genuine link to Scotland.\nHis Gaelic-speaking mother, Mary Anne MacLeod\n, was born in 1912 on the island of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides and left during the Great Depression for New York where she married property developer Fred Trump.\nTheir son's return to Scotland for four days this summer comes ahead of an official state visit in September when the president and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle in Berkshire.\nTrump is not scheduled to see the King on this visit but it is not entirely private either as he will meet Scotland's First Minister John Swinney as well as the prime minister.\nBusiness leaders, including Scotch whisky producers, are urging Starmer and Swinney to use their meetings with Trump to lobby for a reduction in US taxes on imports, known as tariffs.\nA huge security operation, which has been under way for weeks, has been scaled up in recent days.\nGiant transport aircraft carrying military hardware, including the president's helicopters, known when he is on board by the call sign Marine One, have been spotted at Aberdeen and Prestwick airports.\nRoads and lanes in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire have been secured and closed.\nAirspace restrictions have been issued.\nPolice reinforcements have been heading north across the England-Scotland border.\nVisits to Scotland by sitting US presidents are rare.\nQueen Elizabeth hosted Dwight D Eisenhower at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire in 1957\n. George W Bush travelled to Gleneagles in Perthshire for a G8 summit in 2005 and Joe Biden attended a climate conference in Glasgow in 2021.\nThe\nonly other serving president to visit this century is Trump himself in 2018\nwhen he was met by protesters including one flying a paraglider low over Turnberry, breaching the air exclusion zone around the resort.\nDonald Trump's private Boeing 757 jet parked on an aircraft ramp at Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire, Scotland, ahead of the US President's planned visit\nEven by the standards of Donald Trump the years since have been wild.\nWhen he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden a mob of Trump supporters responded to their leader's false claims of electoral fraud by mounting a violent assault on the US Capitol.\nFour years later Trump staged a stunning political comeback.\nHe\nsurvived an assassination attempt\nwhile running for the White House and a man has been charged with trying to assassinate then-candidate Trump by aiming a rifle through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.\nAmid this turmoil, security surrounding the president is supposedly tighter than ever.\nThe US Secret Service, much criticised for failures which nearly cost the president his life, remains primarily responsible for his safety but concerns have been raised about the impact of his visit on Police Scotland's officers and budget, with one former senior officer estimating the policing cost at more than £5m.\nAdding to the pressure which the police are under to secure his resorts, large anti-Trump demonstrations are expected to be held in Aberdeen and Edinburgh.\nPolice Scotland\ninsists it has the resources it needs\nto deal with the visit.\nGetty Images\nTrump's last visit as president sparked protests across the country\nWhile\npolls suggest Trump is deeply unpopular in the UK\n, he may actually find some sympathy in Aberdeen, a city which he and many others call \"the oil capital of Europe\".\nHe has stirred the heated debate about the nature and pace of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, telling BBC News last week that Aberdeen, which has prospered for decades from North Sea drilling, \"\nshould get rid of the windmills and bring back the oil.\n\"\nThe environmental campaign group Uplift says Trump's claim that the North Sea can still provide the UK with a secure energy supply \"runs counter to reality.\"\nTrump's pro-oil message echoes the rhetoric of Reform UK, the right-wing party led by Trump fan Nigel Farage which made progress in a recent Scottish by-election and hopes to go one step further by winning seats for the first time in next year's Scottish parliamentary election.\nThe Scottish Parliament, known as Holyrood after its location at the foot of Edinburgh's Royal Mile, runs much of Scotland's domestic affairs, such as health, education and some taxation and benefits, while the UK parliament in London retains control of defence, foreign affairs and wider economic policy.\nGetty Images\nSecurity and police teams surrounded the perimeter of Turnberry as Donald Trump played golf on his last visit as president in July 2018\nTrump's support for the oil industry is well known but his hatred of wind turbines appears to run even deeper.\nIn 2012 he told me that building a wind farm off the coast of his golf course at Menie\nwould be a \"terrible error\" that would \"destroy Scotland\n.\"\nThat encounter was a strange experience.\nAt first, Trump's aides told us he was so affronted by the difficult questions he had been asked by Rona Dougall of STV News earlier that morning that he had changed his mind about speaking to the BBC.\nWe waited anyway in the rain, for hours. Eventually the man himself emerged. After some verbal sparring he offered us burgers from a barbecue before backing down and agreeing to be interviewed.\nLater, asked by a committee of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to provide evidence to back up his claim that Scottish tourism would be ruined by wind turbines,\nTrump famously replied: \"I am the evidence.\"\nThe wind farm was built anyway and is now clearly visible from the course.\nGetty Images\nDonald Trump poses with Scottish pipers during a visit to the construction site of his golf course on the Menie Estate in 2010\nGetty Images\nTrump appeared at the Scottish Parliament in 2012 to complain about wind turbines near his golf course\nIt is not the only battle Trump has fought against a backdrop of shifting sand dunes and whispering grasses at Menie where\nhe has repeatedly clashed with local residents, politicians and environmentalists\nfor a variety of reasons.\nHis other course at Turnberry is not controversial itself but it is the stage for a tussle with the golfing authorities because Trump appears to be infuriated by the refusal of the game's governing body, the R&A, to stage the prestigious Open Championship there, citing logistical challenges.\nTurnberry is home to three golf courses, said to be\nthe most expensive to play in the UK\n, and the Open has been held there four times but\nnever since Trump purchased it in 2014\n.\nIt is another striking example of how, a decade after mounting what was essentially a hostile takeover of the US Republican Party, the man who has been both the 45th and 47th president of the US has still not entirely swapped business for politics.\nHe is the most powerful man in the Western world and yet Donald Trump is still irked at being snubbed, still hankering for status, still angry about a golfing deal he has, so far at least, failed to close.\nWhat do we know about Donald Trump's visit to Scotland?\nDonald Trump and the Scots: A not-so special relationship\nSecurity ramped up ahead of Trump arrival\nTurnberry\nScotland\nDonald Trump"

This is not a coincidence,\" crown prosecutor Monika Knowles told the trial, according to local media.\nWard will return to court later this year to be sentenced.\nThe NSW government had previously considered voting to expel Ward - who has been a state MP since 2011 - from parliament, but legal advice indicated it could risk prejudicing his trial.\nAustralia"

        "content": "Thailand warns clashes with Cambodia could 'move towards war'\n2 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nKelly Ng\nBBC News, Singapore\nJonathan Head\nSouth East Asia correspondent, Surin\nShare\nSave\nWatch: People take shelter after gunfire breaks out between Thailand and Cambodia troops\nThailand's leader has warned that clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, which have killed at least 16 people and displaced tens of thousands in both countries, could \"move towards war\".\nActing Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai added that the fighting now included heavy weapons and had spread to 12 locations along the border.\nThailand also accused Cambodia of firing into civilian areas and evacuated all villages deemed to be within the radius of its rockets.\nCambodia, for its part, accused Thailand of using cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are banned in much of the world because of their indiscriminate effect on civilian populations. Thailand has not responded to the allegations.\nMeanwhile, Thailand's foreign minister told the Reuters news agency that there was \"no need\" for third-party mediation in the conflict, even as global leaders appealed for an immediate ceasefire.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chairs the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, had earlier offered to facilitate talks between the two countries.\n\"I welcome the positive signals and willingness shown by both Bangkok and Phnom Penh to consider this path forward,\" Anwar wrote on Facebook late Thursday.\nBut Thai foreign ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura told Reuters that the situation must be solved through bilateral means, adding that Phnom Penh must stop its offensive moves.\n\"I don't think we need any mediation from a third country yet,\" Nikorndej said.\nThe comments came as both countries updated the death toll from the fighting.\nThailand said 14 civilians and one soldier were killed in the fighting, while provincial authorities in Cambodia said at least one civilian in Oddar Meanchey was killed.\nThe US has also called for an \"immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and a peaceful resolution of the conflict\".\n\"We are... gravely concerned by the escalating violence along the Thailand Cambodia border, and deeply saddened by reports of harm to civilians,\" State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said at a regular media briefing.\nChina, which has political and strategic ties with Cambodia and Thailand, said it is \"deeply concerned\" over the conflict and hopes both sides can resolve issues through dialogue and consultation.\nAustralia, the European Union and France have also called for peace.\nThe United Nations Security Council is expected to meet on Friday over the conflict.\nIn a letter to the council on Thursday, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet had urged it to intervene to \"stop Thailand's aggression\".\nThailand and Cambodia have each accused the other of firing the first shots on Thursday.\nThailand claims the clash began with Cambodia's military deploying drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border.\nCambodia says Thai soldiers initiated the conflict when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border.\nThe dispute between the two countries dates back to more than a hundred years ago, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.\nThere were sporadic clashes over the years which saw soldiers and civilians killed on both sides.\nThe latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.\nAt a sports complex that was converted into an evacuation centre in Thailand's Surin province, evacuees - many of them children and elderly - said they were still shaken by the rocket and artillery attacks they witnessed on Thursday.\nOlder evacuees who had lived through bombardments during the Cambodian Civil War of the 1980s told the BBC the recent fighting was the worst they had experienced.\nJoi Phasuwan, from the Phanom Dong Rak district, said she and her two grandchildren \"waited a long time\" before they finally got moved to the evacuation centre.

But the ruling means she has been granted a reprieve from possible ousting, at least until February 2026.\nThis also gives her more time to gather support for a possible presidential run in the crucial run-up years to the 2028 general elections.\nHad the impeachment vote gone against her, Duterte would not have been able to run for president.\nThe ruling is the latest development in the dramatic Duterte-Marcos saga, which has seen them go from allies to foes. Both children of powerful former leaders, the two had joined hands in 2022 to form a political super alliance known as the \"Uniteam\".\nBut after the duo swept to victory, the cracks soon began to appear.\nA war of words that saw even Sara's father Rodrigo Duterte call Marcos a \"drug addict\" reached a climax last November, when she made a Facebook post claiming that if she were to be killed she had \"spoken to a person\" to ensure the President was killed too. This comment\ntriggered the impeachment proceedings\nagainst her.\nThings then became even more personal when Sara's father\nwas suddenly extradited to the Hague\nto face charges of crimes against humanity for his notorious war on drugs, which is believed to have killed thousands of people.\nBut even before this ruling, the odds of convicting Sara in the Senate impeachment court, or even starting the proceedings, was uncertain due to shifting political alliances that followed the general election in May.\nThe feud between Duterte and Marcos had dominated the election, and Duterte won more seats in the Senate than expected, in what was seen as a rebuff of the incumbent.\nThe 15-member Supreme Court is dominated by appointees of Sara's father.\nImpeachment proceedings are extremely divisive in Philippine's chaotic political landscape. Since the restoration of democracy to the country in 1986, only one such attempt has successfully ended with a verdict - that of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona, who was convicted of hiding his assets in 2012.\nFormer president Joseph Estrada's impeachment for alleged graft was cut short in 2001, after public anger over the conduct of the trial sparked massive street protests that eventually led to his ouster.\nAsia\nPhilippines"

But even that only lasted 12 to 14 days, depending on the exact location.\n\"That record has now been broken.\"\nIt's not just Rovaniemi that's been gripped by scorching temperatures. Several other weather stations across Lapland have registered their longest ever heatwaves on record.\nThe highest temperature of the heatwave, 31.7C, was measured at two locations, Ylitornio and Sodankylä, earlier this week. That's about 10C above the seasonal average for Lapland. On Friday, 30.3C was recorded at Koitsanlahti in the south-east.\nBBC/Erika Benke\nThe thermometer at the Santa Claus village in Lapland this week read 33C in the sun\nThe heatwave has prompted renewed concern about the accelerating pace of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the Earth.\nSavela notes that this particular, long heatwave was not directly caused by climate change. However, he says, \"Climate change has had an impact: without it, temperatures over the last two weeks would have been lower\".\nProf Jeff Welker, University of the Arctic Research Chair at the University of Oulu, agrees.\nWhat is climate change? A really simple guide\nHeatwave to ease in holiday hotspots after Greece and Turkey surge above 40C\nHeatwaves and extreme weather events in summer and winter alike have become so frequent that they can only have been caused by fundamental changes to the climate system.\n\"All over the world, every day, climate change is manifested in extreme heat and extreme precipitation events,\" says Prof Welker. \"The fingerprint of climate change is upon us.\"\nHeatwaves are becoming more common due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nExtreme hot weather will happen more often – and become even more intense – as the planet continues to warm, it has said.\nThe extreme heat is also affecting Lapland's famed reindeer.\nCelebrated worldwide as Santa's sleigh-pullers at Christmas, reindeer here roam freely across forests and fells. But as they're hounded by mosquitoes – which thrive in hot weather – reindeer are now fleeing to roads and villages in search of relief.\n\"For reindeer the only option would be to go to higher, windier elevations but in Finnish Lapland the highest elevation is only about 1,000m (3,300 ft),\" says Prof Welker.\nHe adds that because more extreme and longer heatwaves will occur more frequently in the Arctic in the future, \"reindeer herders might end up having to build big barns to provide shade for their animals\".\nIt's not just Santa and his reindeer who are struggling. Lapland is traditionally known as a cool tourist destination – but this year, visitors are puzzled.\n\"It's super-hot here – 30C is killing me. I came to escape the heat,\" says Silvia, a tourist from Prague visiting Santa's holiday village in Rovaniemi.\n\"I expected much colder weather and packed the wrong clothes. I only have one short-sleeve t-shirt with me – I've been wearing it every day.\"\nBBC/Erika Benke\n\"I expected much colder weather and packed the wrong clothes,\" said Silvia from Prague\nIt doesn't help that days in Rovaniemi are currently 20 hours a day, so the sun is still shining until well after 23:00 – keeping temperatures up for longer.\nHunkering down in a shady patch in Santa Park is Adita from London, who expected to find temperatures under 20C here. \"I can barely even step outside the shade, I feel like I'm on fire when I do,\" she says.\n\"Something similar is happening in the UK but I'm very surprised to see this at the Arctic Circle,\" she says. \"Ice and snow is so integral to this amusement park and the whole of Lapland.\"\nElina, an elf working in Santa's post office, also worries about the future of Lapland's winters: \"I'm wondering if heatwaves are now the new normal.\"\nFor Santa, there is the added problem of having to wear his heavy costume every day of the year.\nAt the moment he only goes outdoors in the evenings once the air starts cooling down, otherwise he risks getting heatstroke in just 10 minutes.\n\"Of course a hot summer can be very nice for some but I prefer cold and snow,\" he says. \"Winter is better.\"\nEurope\nChristmas"

So it was a good day.\"\nIn a short post on X, Blanche wrote: \"Today, I met with Ghislaine Maxwell, and I will continue my interview of her tomorrow. The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\"\nBlanche said earlier this week that he planned to speak to Maxwell about any information she had on other people who might have been helped by Epstein to sexually abuse girls.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat and fierce Trump critic, took issue with the fact that Trump sent Blanche, his former personal lawyer turned federal prosecutor, to interview Maxwell ahead of her potential public testimony.\n\"The conflict of interest is glaring. It stinks of high corruption,\" he said on X.\nGetty Images\nPublic focus in the Epstein matter has recently switched back to Maxwell, who helped Epstein abuse young girls\nWhat do we know about the Epstein files?\nWhite House pushes back after reports Trump is named in Epstein files\nAccuser says 'rollercoaster' of Epstein saga is a 'real weight' on victims\nIn a post on Truth Social late on Thursday, Trump said the renewed focus on Epstein was a \"SCAM\" and a \"Democrat CON JOB\", and accused Schumer's party of trying to \"distract and obfuscate\" from the achievements of the first six months of his second term in office.\nAsked on Friday whether he would consider giving Maxwell clemency, Trump said he was allowed to do so but had \"not thought\" about it.\n\"I can't talk about that now. … it's very sensitive,\" he said when asked again.\nCalls have recently intensified from the US public - including Trump's loyal supporters - and lawmakers for the justice department to release files related to the Epstein matter.\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name appeared in justice department documents related to Epstein.\nTrump and Epstein were friends before, according to the president, they fell out in the early 2000s.\nThe White House pushed back, dismissing the WSJ story as \"fake news\".\nBut an unnamed White House official told the Reuters news agency they were not denying that Trump's name appears in the documents.\nThe official pointed to Epstein files disclosed months earlier by the justice department that had included Trump.\nBeing named in the documents is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case.\nWatch: How are Americans reacting to Trump's handling of the Epstein files?\nWhile campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump had promised to release such files about the well-connected sex offender.\nBut his supporters have since grown frustrated with the administration's handling of the issue, including its failure to deliver a rumoured \"client list\" of Epstein. In a memo earlier this month, the justice department and FBI said there was no such list.\nEpstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. His death was ruled a suicide.\nIn the years since, conspiracy theories about the nature of his crimes and his death itself have proliferated.\nOn Wednesday, a sub-committee of the US House of Representatives voted to subpoena the justice department for the files, which must be signed off by the committee chairman.\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee have also subpoenaed Maxwell to testify before the panel remotely from prison on 11 August.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell - who for years helped Epstein groom and sexually abuse girls - cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony.\nMaxwell's lawyer, Markus, previously told the BBC the concerns were \"unfounded\" and that if she chose to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, \"she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would\".\nLast week, the justice department asked a federal judge to release years-old grand jury testimony related to a 2006 Florida investigation into Epstein, but a federal judge in the state on Wednesday declined to make the documents public.\nWhite House pushes back after reports Trump is named in Epstein files\nAccuser says 'rollercoaster' of Epstein files saga is a 'real weight' on victims\nWhat do we know about the Epstein files?\nFlorida\nGhislaine Maxwell\nJeffrey Epstein\nSex trafficking\nUnited States"

There have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, too – in 2008 and 2011, clashes on a similar scale saw 40 people killed.\nHowever, these were de-escalated relatively quickly.\nEven as recently as this May, after an incident in which a Cambodian soldier was killed, both sides looked keen to prevent more violence, with meetings between army commanders from each country aimed at easing the tension.\nBut on Thursday, it erupted. Thai authorities said at least 15 people, all civilians apart from one, had been killed so far,\nas fighting continued on Friday\n.\nAt least one civilian has been killed in Cambodia, provincial authorities said.\nSo why has this particular border skirmish – which kicked off after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Wednesday – spread into something so much larger?\nRelations between the two countries deteriorated sharply last month, when Cambodia's senior leader Hun Sen deeply embarrassed Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by leaking a phone conversation between them about the disputed border.\nIn the conversation, Paetongtarn called him \"uncle\", and criticised one of her own military commanders, sparking public anger. She has since been suspended as prime minister and Thailand's Constitutional Court is considering a petition for her dismissal.\nIt is not clear why Hun Sen chose to do this, burning a close personal relationship between their two families that goes back decades.\nEPA\nThai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended in early July\nMany people have faulted Paetongtarn for her conversation with Hun Sen. She appeared to believe that she could resolve their differences by appealing to his friendship with her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\nIn the past that friendship was used by Thaksin's opponents to charge him with putting Cambodia's interests above those of Thailand.\nIn 2014, when a government headed by Thaksin's sister Yingluck was deposed by a military coup, Hun Sen allowed scores of his supporters to seek sanctuary in Cambodia.\nThe two countries have also cooperated in more shadowy areas.\nLast November, Thailand sent six Cambodian dissidents, together with a young child, back to Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed. All were recognised by the United Nations as refugees.\nTwelve killed in Thailand-Cambodia military clashes on disputed border\nThai prime minister suspended over leaked phone call\nIn 2020, a young Thai activist who had fled to Cambodia, Wanchalerm Satsaksit, was abducted and disappeared, it is presumed by Thai operatives.\nAnd the January gunning down of a Cambodian opposition leader in broad daylight in central Bangkok was also seen by activists as an outcome of this understanding between the two countries' security services.\nAgainst this background, the leaking of Paetongtarn's conversation appears to have caught the Shinawatra family completely off-guard.\nThe responses from both Thaksin and Paetongtarn reveal a sense of betrayal. This has led to an increasingly bitter war of words between the two countries.\nBut it is more than just words.\nThai police have also begun investigating powerful Cambodian business figures alleged to be linked to underworld gambling and scam centres, while trade worth billions of dollars a year has stopped.\nAt the border itself, there is a heightened risk of more serious clashes between the two armies.\nBut rather than back off, Cambodia's Hun Sen seems to have jumped at the opportunity to ramp up rhetoric against Thailand and the Shinawatra family in particular.\nHe claims to be in possession of secret documents that would incriminate Thaksin – documents he claims could even prove that he insulted the monarchy, an offence which comes with a hefty prison sentence in Thailand.\nThe Thai government responded by expelling the Cambodian ambassador on Wednesday and recalling its own envoy, setting the stage for the latest confrontation.\nReuters\nHun Sen (left) sits with Thaksin Shinawatra (right)\nFor now neither side looks willing to step back. In both countries, there is a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to compromise.\nIn Prime Minister Hun Manet, Cambodia has the inexperienced son of a former strongman who does not yet have his own authority, while in his father Hun Sen it also has a man who appears willing to push this conflict further.\nOn the Thai side, the shaky coalition government centred on Thaksin's party is dealing with a stagnant economy and reeling from the threat of punitive US tariffs. It cannot afford to show weakness in standing up to Cambodia.\nCambodia too is dealing with a struggling economy.\nIt never fully recovered from the pandemic and tourism - a pillar of its economy - has suffered from the absence of Chinese visitors staying away for fear of being kidnapped and forced to work in scam centres.\nAnd - as with Thailand - now there is the threat of punishing US tariffs impacting the economy further.\nBut both countries do have experienced politicians in Hun Sen and Thaksin who almost certainly can, when they are both ready, find a way out of this.\nWe will also have to see whether other members of Asean weigh in on this conflict and try to persuade both countries to de-escalate.\nThat was originally Asean's primary purpose - to avoid conflict among its members - and it will be a priority for some of the Asean states at the moment to help these two countries resolve the conflict.\nWhat remains a mystery at this point though is why Hun Sen decided to burn this friendship and inflame this conflict.\nPerhaps it was Thailand's decision to put pressure on scam centres this year, or Thaksin's ambition to legalize gambling, threatening Cambodia's own lucrative casino industry.\nOr perhaps it was something simpler: a Machiavellian move by one of Asia's wiliest political survivors, to abandon an ally in Thaksin who has lost much of his influence in Thailand, while at the same time burnishing his nationalist credentials in the eyes of his own people.\nAsia\nThailand\nCambodia"

But already it has deepened political divisions, with both sides of the debate claiming to be the saviour of Taiwan's sacred democracy.\nIt began with last January's elections, when voters chose the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) William Lai as their president, but gave the opposition the dominant presence in the parliamentary Legislative Yuan.\nIn the following months, the main opposition party Kuomintang worked together with the smaller Taiwan People's Party and independents to block DPP bills and pass controversial pieces of legislation. This included limiting the constitutional court's powers, cutting the government's budget, and raising the threshold for holding recall votes.\nThese moves provoked significant outrage among some Taiwanese, who saw them as stymying the DPP government while strengthening the opposition's parliamentary power.\nIn May 2024, thousands began holding protests in what became known as the Bluebird movement, named partially after the Taipei street where many had gathered.\nGetty Images\nProtests last May against Taiwan's lawmakers drew tens of thousands of people\nMany in the movement believe the opposition, led by the Kuomintang which is known for its relatively friendlier position on China, is being influenced by Beijing and secretly pushing China's agenda in Taiwan's legislature.\nThe party has denied this, but suspicion grew when a group of Kuomintang lawmakers visited China last year and were welcomed by top-ranking Chinese Communist Party official Wang Huning.\nCivic groups in the Bluebird movement launched petitions to oust various Kuomintang lawmakers, while Kuomintang supporters retaliated by doing the same to some DPP lawmakers.\nSo far, petitions for 31 lawmakers' seats have received enough preliminary support to proceed with a final recall vote. All these seats are held by the Kuomintang - and if enough are successfully recalled, it could mean the DPP eventually gains the majority in the legislature.\nWhile Taiwan has held recall votes before, it has never seen so many within such a short space of time.\nOn Saturday, citizens in 24 districts will vote on a simple yes or no question: whether they agree to boot out their legislator. Another round of voting will be held in August for the remaining recall cases.\nIn each district, if the number of votes exceeds 25% of registered voters and more than half approve the recall, the seat will be vacated and a by-election must be held within three months.\nThis means that voter turnout is crucial for the Great Recall's success - and it is the reason why civic groups have been relentlessly flooding social media and pounding the streets canvassing for votes.\nOn a recent weekday night, Deng Pu and several members of his civic group stood outside a Taipei subway station. Some held up banners and chanted slogans, while others distributed paper fans and tissue packets emblazoned with the words \"Let's go out together to vote\" and \"Say yes to the recall\".\nMr Deng acknowledged that with several of the recall votes taking place in Kuomintang strongholds, even if they did succeed, the party could be re-elected in by-elections.\nEven so, the Great Recall would still be worth it, he insisted, as it was a way to \"correct our democracy\".\nWhatever the result may be, it would \"send a strong signal to all the political parties you must respect the latest wishes of Taiwan's citizens.\"\nMr Deng acknowledged that many in the Bluebird movement were DPP supporters, but denied that the civic groups were funded by the party – a theory heavily pushed by the opposition.\n\"We don't care whether DPP wins the by-elections. What's more urgent to us is that we hope to have a normal parliament, one that is not close to China and the Chinese Communist Party.\"\nHe also took issue with what he saw as a weak response from the DPP, saying: \"From the first recall petition till now, the civic groups have been telling the DPP that the citizens are here and there are many of us... We are strongly calling on the DPP to join us.\"\nBBC / Tessa Wong\nDeng Pu decided to join the Bluebird movement as he was angry at what he saw as undemocratic behaviour by Taiwanese lawmakers\nThe DPP had initially sought to distance itself from the Great Recall. But eventually it showed its support, with Lai stressing that the DPP \"must align with the power of the people\" and ordering party officials to assist pro-recall groups to \"protect the nation\".\nThis has inevitably fueled the opposition's accusation that the DPP has secretly engineered the Great Recall and Bluebird movement, pointing to the fact that the DPP could reap the most political gain.\nIt not only stands a chance of winning a permanent majority in the legislature. Even if the Kuomintang eventually wins in the by-elections, the DPP would have held the majority for a few weeks, giving it enough time to push through crucial laws.\nAnti-recall protests organised by the Kuomintang and other opposition parties have drawn thousands. At one such rally in the New Taipei district of Banqiao last weekend, supporters showed up waving banners and chanting \"No to the vote\" while crossing their arms.\nAs they took to the stage, speaker after speaker condemned the Great Recall while characterising William Lai as a fascist and authoritarian traitor of Taiwan's democracy.\nLarge screens played videos of Lai doctored to make him look like Adolf Hitler with the words \"Fuhrer Lai\", as well as the slogan \"Green Terror\" – a reference to the DPP's party colour and the White Terror, a period of authoritarian rule and political repression under the Kuomintang.\nThe rhetoric echoed that of Beijing, which has waded into the debate while watching from afar. Its Taiwan Affairs Office has accused Lai of \"engaging in dictatorship under the guise of democracy\" and \"using every means possible to suppress the opposition\".\n\"The recall lawmakers were chosen by the majority of voters in their districts. If they are not good enough, they can be voted out in the next election,\" said rally attendee Mu Zili. \"Why should we be using this evil way of getting rid of them?\"\nThe 68-year-old night shift worker insisted that the lawmakers were being targeted simply because they belonged to the Kuomintang, and that the Bluebird activists were working for the DPP.\n\"You can't have one party take down the other one in one big recall, this is not democratic,\" Ms Mu said.\n\"I side with blue,\" she added, referring to the Kuomintang's party colour. \"But I don't oppose green. I'm here not because I support the Kuomintang, but to protect democracy.\"\nBut there are also many Taiwanese who are on the fence.\nWatching the anti-recall rally from the sidelines was Banqiao resident Peggy Lin. Like several other bystanders the BBC spoke to, she was bewildered by the fuss over the Great Recall.\n\"I don't know what it's about really, I haven't followed the debate at all… so I don't have an opinion,\" said the 43-year-old childcare worker.\n\"I will vote after I read more into it and decide based on how I feel on that day about it.\"\nBBC / Tessa Wong\nSupporters at a recent rally in Banqiao held up inflatable sticks and crossed them to indicate their opposition to the Great Recall\nAnalysts say that regardless of the outcome, the Great Recall will leave a lasting impact on Taiwan's polarised society.\nThe political fighting has gotten nasty at times. Legislators have brawled in parliament over the political deadlock, while activists have faced doxxing and abuse. Mr Deng told the BBC that while out canvassing, he and his team mates had been assaulted or pushed around by residents opposing the vote.\nThe vote has also not gone without scandal: officials have discovered numerous forged signatures, many of deceased voters, in recall petitions against both DPP and Kuomintang lawmakers.\nThe vote \"will cement the notion of four year terms as not a given but as conditional on performance and subject to periodic reviews. Political polarisation will likely get worse before it gets better,\" said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University's Taiwan Studies programme.\nBut the Great Recall is also \"creating space for renewed political activism\", especially for DPP supporters, added Dr Sung, which he characterised as an overall boon to the resiliency of Taiwan's civil society.\nIan Chong, a non-resident scholar with Carnegie China, said if many of the recall votes succeed, \"one signal it would send to politicians in Taiwan is that they should be careful with how far they push the line in public sentiment… they can't stray too far as there would be consequences\".\n\"But if it fizzles out, then it emboldens politicians to do what they want,\" he noted.\n\"It will intensify the polarisation… and it would be easy for politicians to write off the Great Recall as yet another civil society movement that doesn't get enough momentum beyond a certain part of the population.\"\nIf there was a close but not conclusive result overall, however, it may mean \"the Kuomintang and DPP will have to ultimately seek compromise and work together\".\nThis, added Dr Chong, \"may not be a bad thing for Taiwan\".\nChina\nTaiwan"

Within seconds, the mess is mopped up.\n\"You literally have tissues with you? I'm so impressed,\" Rapp squeals... Before admitting her parents are basically the same.\n\"My dad brings hair bands everywhere because I'm always without a hair tie,\" says the 25-year-old. \"So I know I'm going to be an insufferable parent.\n\"I'll be saying, 'please let me brush your teeth', and the kid's going to be, like, 17.\"\nYouTube\nRapp's \"speak first, think later\" interviews went viral on YouTube last year\nWe meet in London's King's Cross, near Rapp's record label offices. She's a little frazzled after two days of live shows; and somewhat sleep deprived, thanks to a group of kids who have been running races in the corridor outside her hotel room.\nYet she's friendly and engaging, full of zingy quotes that confirm her reputation as pop's most unfiltered star.\nThat's a label she acquired while promoting last year's Mean Girls film. Rapp played central villainess Regina George, reprising a role she originated on Broadway, and spent the press tour gleefully going off script.\nShe tore into the owner of a bus company whose boss had been an \"asshole\" to her mum, declaring, \"I can't stand you and I hope your business burns\"; and praised co-star Megan Thee Stallion for having \"the best ass I've ever seen in my life\".\nElsewhere, she confessed to being \"very publicly ageist\" and said her only male crush was Justin Bieber, because he \"looks like a lesbian\".\nYouTube is full of compilations with titles such as: \"\nReneé Rapp making her PR team question their life choices for 5 minutes straight\n\".\nThe singer knows what media training looks like, she just doesn't vibe with it.\n\"I got on a phone call years ago where they were telling us how to answer certain kinds of question, and what not to say,\" she recalls, \"and I just remember being like, 'This feels so boring to me'.\n\"I think it's a skill to be able to give a thought-out, fluffy answer. It's just not something that I want.\"\n\"Good interviews, to me, are like a conversation that illustrates how you get on with the other person... or you don't. And that's fun. That's something I want to watch.\"\nGetty Images\nWhen she first discovered her interviews were attracting attention, however, it caught her off guard.\n\"Everybody on my team was like, 'Oh, there's a trend going on where you just say whatever [comes into your head].\n\"It was confusing because, to me, I didn't really understand what I was doing, other than speaking exactly how I've always spoken since I was a kid.\n\"And I actually got insecure about it a bit last year - because I never imagined my personality and the cadence of my speech would be analysed.\"\nEventually, Rapp summoned the courage to watch some of those YouTube compilations, \"and I was like, OK, this\nis\nkind of funny\".\n\"I just realised that I couldn't stop it or tone it down. So I just ran with it.\"\nShe even pokes fun at the situation on her recent single\nLeave Me Alone\n.\n\"\nSigned a hundred NDAs but I still say something\n,\" she snarls with punky brio over an punchy, Oh Mickey drumbeat.\n'Get off my back'\nLeave Me Alone is a witty response to the people who've tried to sand off Rapp's rough edges. But it was born of real frustration.\nLast March, she had just wrapped up a European tour, at the same time as the Mean Girls single Not My Fault gave her the biggest hit of her career so far. Suddenly, she was under pressure to follow it up.\n\"I was told that, basically, everybody wanted me to put a single out in the summer and an album in the fall,\" she says.\n\"I started panicking. I was like, 'Holy crap, how am I gonna do that?', because I was really, really, really depressed last year. I was so overworked, and I was so run down. I didn't have any time to get myself together.\n\"I was crying to my girlfriend about it, like, 'I have no idea how I'm going to do this'. And she was literally like, 'You don't have to, and, by the way, you shouldn't'.\"\nRapp agreed with the advice but went to work regardless, a by-product of career insecurity and a need for approval.\n\"I was like, 'This is what somebody's asking of me, so I can't not fulfil that, because that means I'm not working hard enough, and that means I don't want it enough'.\"\nZora Sicher\nRapp's mother deliberately gave her an alliterative name \"just in case you want to be a star\"\nThat single-minded, almost masochistic, focus comes from her parents.\nHer dad's a medical salesman, while her mum, an accountant, now acts as her business manager.\n\"People are like, 'Woo, that must be hard, the mother-daughter dynamic',\" she says.\n\"Of course there are difficult moments, but I have difficult moments working with people that I'm not related to as well - and no one's ever going to protect me like my mother.\n\"Other people will throw me under the bus faster than you can blink an [expletive] eye.\n\"Both my parents,\" she concludes, \"care so much about each other and our family, that there's just sort of an aggression and a determination that translated to me, especially when it comes to work.\"\nLike many perfectionists before her, however, Rapp discovered she couldn't just power through the tiredness and annoyance.\nArriving at the studio to work on new music, everything spilled out.\n\"I was basically ranting, saying I wished people would get off my back.\n\"And everybody in the room said, '\nThat's the song\n'.\"\nFalling for a 'British princess'\nWritten on the spur of the moment, Leave Me Alone quickly became the obvious choice to launch Rapp's second album, Bite Me.\nBefore the interview, she plays me six of the record's 12 songs, including an irresistibly catchy tribute to her girlfriend, Towa Bird.\nTitled Shy, it describes how Rapp became tongue-tied around the British musician when they toured together in 2023.\n\"I am not a shy person whatsoever, so that made me realise how madly in love I was with her,\" she says.\n\"I'd just got out of a relationship and I was so relieved to be on my own, then I was smacked in the face by these feelings.\n\"I was a nervous wreck, like, 'I want to throw up'.\"\nShe's still besotted today. Her opal blue eyes glow as she rhapsodises about her \"British princess\".\n\"Not only is she my best friend and my most trusted confidant, but also she wants me to win just as much as I want her to win – and that feeling is so scarce.\"\nGetty Images\nTowa Bird joined Reneé Rapp on stage for her performance at the 2024 Coachella Festival\nElsewhere, the album reflects on Rapp's former flames, including a pair of tracks that explore what happens when a third person inserts themselves into a relationship.\nOn Why Is She Still Here, Rapp confronts her partner about a girl who's gotten a little too close: \"\nYou tell me you don't love her/ but you should probably tell her, too.\n\"\nFlipping the script, Rapp severs ties with a friend when the temptation to stray becomes too strong on the melancholy ballad I Can't Have You Around Me.\nShe sings it quietly, like an apology, with a subtlety that wasn't always present on her debut album, Snow Angel.\n\"Being a theatre girl, transitioning to pop music can be really difficult,\" confesses the star, who literally has the phrase Plus De Voix (more vocals) tattooed on her left wrist.\n\"You go from singing your guts out, to trying to tailor that voice and that volume to a studio setting.\n\"It was really hard for me, working out how to give the same quality of performance, but also pulling back 5,000 per cent.\n\"But I realised that if I want to have a really successful pop career, I have to make music that doesn't use the same parts of my voice that I use live.\"\nReneé Rapp / Interscope Records\n\"The willingness to go full throttle into my emotions is a such strong suit,\" says the singer.\nShe's looking forward to playing these songs live, but Rapp admits the burnout from her last tour still casts a shadow.\n\"I couldn't name you one set I've played in the last two years where I felt comfortable,\" she says.\n\"I look out [at the audience] and I'm like, 'I gotta go home'.\"\nPart of the issue is that, as her star rose, Rapp's concerts attracted more casual fans and critics.\n\"I guess it's just harder for me to believe now that people care, even though I can see that the ones at the front do,\" she says.\n\"And a lot of voices came into my head. Criticism, self-destruction, labelling yourself not good enough. All of those negative things made it harder for me to perform.\"\nBut with new material (and a much-needed break) under her belt, Rapp's hopeful her upcoming tour, which hits the UK next March, will be different.\n\"Early on in my career, I was so euphoric when I played,\" she says.\n\"It'll be good to remember that feeling.\"\nReneé Rapp: The pop star who willed herself into existence\nPop music\nMusic"

Many of them have been sent to Cecot, on allegations of criminality, under an agreement with El Salvador.\nMervin Yamarte and his friends - Edwuar Hernández Herrera, Andy Perozo and Ringo Rincón - spent four months in the notorious mega-prison before being released in a prisoner exchange last Friday.\nAll four have told BBC News Mundo that during their months in captivity they were subjected to beatings and treated \"like animals\", including being made to eat with their hands.\nThe BBC has approached the Salvadorean government for a response to the allegations, but has not yet received a response.\nIts president, Nayib Bukele, has previously denied such allegations, which have been used by the Venezuelan government to attack him amid an ongoing exchange of accusations. Venezuela is currently facing an investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over allegations similar to those it is levelling at El Salvador.\nMigrants tortured in El Salvador, Venezuela says\nAs part of the prisoner deal that was struck by the governments of the US, Venezuela and El Salvador, a total of 252 Venezuelans were flown from Cecot to the Venezuelan capital, Caracas.\nThe Venezuelans released from Cecot in El Salvador last week were originally deported from the US under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act - a law that was written to allow the removal of individuals who are not US citizens in times of war or invasion.\nThe act was controversially invoked earlier this year by Trump as part of a sweeping effort to deport alleged gang members.\nThe US authorities accused the deported individuals of being members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal gang, and argued that they were \"conducting irregular warfare\" in the US.\nBut the four deportees who spoke to BBC News Mundo in Los Pescadores have denied any links with the Tren de Aragua.\nThey said they were arrested in Texas for alleged immigration offenses after mistakenly being identified as gang members because of their tattoos.\nGustavo Ocando\nIn their hometown, following their incarceration in Cecot, the return of the four men was celebrated with joyous abandon.\nWhen they finally arrived at 16:15 local time on Tuesday, after a 15-hour bus journey from the capital, a noisy caravan of motorbikes sounded their horns to welcome them. \"Volver a Casa\" (Returning Home), a song which has become an anthem for returning Venezuelan migrants, was also blasting at full volume.\nMervin Yamarte, who worked in a tortilla factory in Texas when he was detained, was welcomed by his family at his mother's home.\nHis relatives had decorated the place with balloons in the yellow, blue and red of the Venezuelan flag and had bought him an array of presents - including a watch, a couple of bottles of aftershave and chocolates.\nGustavo Ocando\nMervin Yamarte's family was overjoyed to see him\nBut as Mr Yamarte entered the home, carrying his six-year-old daughter in his arms, he recalled the physical and psychological abuses he says he suffered at Cecot.\n\"The prison director told us that whoever entered [the prison] would never come out,\" he alleged.\nMr Yamarte said the guards forced inmates to eat \"like animals\", using their hands while sitting on the floor.\nHe added that they were hit \"frequently\" and not given anything to clean themselves with.\nOn Monday,\nVenezuela's Attorney-General, Tarek William Saab, denounced the use of \"systemic torture\" at Cecot\n, which he said included sexual abuse, daily beatings and giving inmates rotten food.\nSaab announced Venezuela would investigate President Bukele, as well as Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro and Head of Prisons Osiris Luna Meza, over the alleged abuses.\nBukele replied on X, writing that \"the Maduro regime was satisfied with the prisoner exchange, that's why they accepted it\".\nReferring to the fact that the prisoner exchange included the release of all the US nationals held in Venezuela, Bukele added that \"now they shout and are indignant, not because they disagree with the [prisoners'] treatment, but because they realise they are left without any hostages from the most powerful country in the world\".\nGustavo Ocando\nAndy Perozo received a warm welcome from his family\nSince it was opened in 2023, Cecot has come under repeated and heavy criticism by rights groups over its treatment of inmates, in particular the high number of prisoners per cell and the harsh conditions they are subjected to.\nPrison officials insist it meets international standards. But that is not the experience Andy Perozo said he had.\n\"Beatings were part of the daily routine,\" he told BBC News Mundo at his parents' house in Los Pescadores.\nThe 30-year-old said he was hit by a rubber bullet near his left eye during his time at Cecot.\nHe alleged that the prison authorities would only feed and clothe the inmates well in the immediate run-up to visits by Red Cross delegates, and in order to \"take photos\" that would let the prison appear in a good light.\nInside El Salvador's secretive mega-prison\nMr Hernández Herrera, at 23 the youngest of the four detainees from Los Pescadores, was welcomed home by his mother, Yarelis.\nShe said she spotted her son getting off the plane at Maiquetía airport, outside Caracas, on Friday. About a dozen neighbours had gathered in front of the TV to watch the broadcast of the arrival of the two planes from El Salvador.\n\"It was as if we were watching a football match what with all the crying and shouting,\" she recalled. \"You'd have to be made of stone not to cry.\"\nNext to the entrance of her home, hung a poster with Mr Hernández Herrera's photo and the words \"Welcome home, my love!\".\nBelow the photo, a message for him: \"You know, your mother never gave up on you, nor did your family.\"\nGustavo Ocando\nEdwuar Hernández Herrera was welcomed by his mother Yarelis, who had decorated the porch of her home\nInside, sipping a beer, Mr Hernández Herrera said he, too, suffered \"torture\" inside Cecot, adding that he was \"shot at\" with rubber bullets four times.\n\"The beds were metal, I didn't know if it was better to sleep or stay awake,\" he said, adding, \"we never saw a lawyer or a judge.\"\nMr Rincón, 39, speaking to BBC Mundo sitting with his mother and children, also said he was the victim of abuse, which he alleged started as soon as they arrived in El Salvador.\n\"They beat us until we bled. We were hit as we were dragged off the plane, made to walk hunched over, tied up with up to five shackles.\"\nHe told the BBC that he plans to lodge an official complaint about his treatment inside Cecot through the Venezuelan Attorney-General's office. Another Venezuelan man is already taking action against the US government for sending him to Cecot.\nIn his own description of conditions inside the prison, Andy Perozo told BBC Mundo that the Venezuelan inmates rioted twice after finding out that one of their own had been seriously injured.\nHe blamed one particular guard, a man the inmates dubbed \"Satan\", for the majority of the abuse.\nBut when the topic of conversation turned to his children, Andy Perozo smiled.\nHe hugged them as he posed for a group photo. \"I hardly recognise them, they're so big now,\" he jokes.\nAsked about his plans for the future he said: \"Not leave the country again and work.\"\nVenezuelans deported to mega-prison 'trapped in black hole'\nRare video shows inmates in their cells in El Salvador's mega-jail\n'It's him, it's him!' - Mother spots son deported from US in mega-prison footage\nEl Salvador\nVenezuela\nUnited States"

The star sued and was awarded $140m, eventually settling for $31m, putting Gawker out of business. His legal bill was paid by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who said he wanted to curb Gawker's \"bullying\", and the case was hugely divisive.\nGetty Images\nIn recent years, he divided opinion among fans as one of Donald Trump's most vocal celebrity supporters, endorsing him in his trademark theatrical style at events including the Republican National Convention one year ago, and a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York in October (pictured).\nDwayne Johnson hails 'childhood hero' Hulk Hogan\nUS wrestling legend Hulk Hogan dies aged 71\nProfessional wrestling"

        "content": "How Epstein case is tearing apart Maga's online conspiracy wing\n4 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nMike Wendling\nBBC News\n•\n@mwendling\nShare\nSave\nWatch: Trump calls out \"stupid Republicans\" in Jeffrey Epstein files saga\nIt seems like a simple decision for Donald Trump's administration – release files related to the late convicted paedophile financier Jeffery Epstein, or keep them out of public view.\nBut battles raging among the US president's supporters in some of the more conspiratorial spaces online suggest that the choice facing Trump is not easy at all.\nIn those spaces, users argue about whether to trust the White House, and they speculate on what might be going on behind the scenes and Trump's strategic acumen - which some fans liken to playing a game of \"4D chess\".\n\"Don't get distracted by the Epstein shills,\" wrote one commenter professing his steadfast support for Trump on TheDonald, a popular message board filled with news, conspiracy theories and language ranging from salty to extremely offensive.\n\"I have not once called for the Epstein files to be released because I'm not a complete and total [fool],\" the commenter added.\nBut that sentiment is far from universal.\n\"Epstein transparency NOW!!!\" came one reply.\nAnother user criticised the president over his recent statements that lambasted supporters for focusing on the Epstein issue: \"Don't [lash] out at your own base… That makes you look guilty.\"\nWhat do we know about the Epstein files?\nMaxwell interview about Epstein 'very productive', lawyer says\nWatch: Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer: A \"good day\" for his client after DOJ questioning\nAs the saga rumbles on - fuelled by reports giving further details of Trump's relationship with Epstein, and justice department meetings with Epstein's partner in crime Ghislaine Maxwell - pro-Trump online spaces heavily invested in conspiratorial thinking are divided in much the same way as more mainstream Republicans.\nTrump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but has not been accused of any wrongdoing as part of the investigations into his former friend.\nAccording to Trump, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has recently suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".\nAlthough the contents of any unreleased documents remain unknown, the existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures who were connected to Epstein - though that does not imply any illegal activity.\nThe president previously said he would be open to making public more information on Epstein. But he changed his position earlier this month, saying the case was closed.\nThe frustration over what many Americans see as a simple request is now being given voice by some prominent allies of the president.\n\"Look, I'm where I've been every time y'all ask me this question,\" said Thom Tillis, a US senator in Trump's Republican Party who has sometimes tangled with Trump. \"Release the damn files.\"\nWatch: How are Americans reacting to Trump's handling of the Epstein files?\nA US justice department official spoke to Maxwell in prison on Thursday, although few details emerged about what she was questioned about and how she responded.\nAlthough Trump's biggest supporters are sticking by the president, many are trying to square their backing for his Make America Great Again (Maga) movement with what they apparently see as his stonewalling of further information drops.\nMaga influencers have found themselves on the defensive as they try to stand by their man after years of demanding Epstein transparency – a call that was endorsed by Trump during last year's presidential campaign, and vociferously pushed for years by several top administration officials including FBI director Kash Patel.\nLaura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist with a huge social media following, who is an informal yet influential White House adviser, posted a link to a news article in which she said \"Trump is not implicated\" in the Epstein files.\nAlong with messages of support, blowback on X came fast:\n\"How would you know.\"\n\"He literally partied with Epstein.\"\nDozens of other users responded with memes and historical pictures of Trump and Epstein together, before they fell out.\nAnd messages like \"We want to see the Epstein files!\" – which one follower posted at conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk – seem about as common online at the moment as the most popular slogan used by case obsessives: \"Epstein didn't kill himself.\"\nThe phrase is a reference to one of the most common conspiracy theories, that Epstein was killed by an unknown assailant and did not take his own life, as the official narrative states, when he died in prison in 2019.\nThe justice department and FBI rejected that theory in a memo earlier this month. They also said they had no rumoured Epstein \"client list\" that could implicate high-profile associates besides Maxwell in Epstein's criminal operation.\nIt was that memo that kicked off the renewed focus on Epstein that has recently dominated the US news cycle.\nReuters\nLike many Maga influencers, Laura Loomer has been caught between loyalty to Trump and demands for more information about Epstein's crimes\nAfter initially questioning government officials, and demanding more document releases, many popular Maga influencers – including Loomer, Jack Posobiec, and pro-Trump Substack blogs and sites like ZeroHedge – appear in recent days to be backing off the topic and trying to turn the attention of their audiences elsewhere.\nBut others - including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and podcaster Benny Johnson - have continued to cover the saga in detail.\nThe episode has driven even some of Trump's most steadfast supporters to turn on the president.\nEarlier this week Jacob Chansley - the so-called QAnon Shaman who was sentenced for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021 wearing horns, fur and face paint - posted a string of expletive-laden messages directed at Trump on X. His account was deleted shortly thereafter.\nWatch: \"It's exhausting\" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga\nHowever, the administration's efforts to highlight other stories do seem to have worked to diffuse the energy in some of the most conspiratorial pro-Trump spaces.\nOn TheDonald, the latest twists in the Epstein case are only one discussion of many.\nCommenters are also talking about topics like vaccines, the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show, and documents recently declassified by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nThose declassified documents, although confirming the prevailing view that Russia tried to influence the race, led Trump allies to call for the arrest of former President Barack Obama after Trump accused his predecessor of trying to falsely tie him to Russia.\nObama labelled Trump's comments a \"ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction\", and was joined by other Democrats who called Gabbard's move a blatant attempt to change the subject.\nAs with the once-promised release of Epstein files, Gabbard may have set up even bigger expectations among the Maga faithful for a reckoning.\nAccuser says Epstein files 'rollercoaster' weighs on victims\nThose still chatting about the Epstein case find themselves in discussion threads trying to work out what they speculate could be hidden meanings behind Trump's actions, and asking questions such as why the Democratic administration of Joe Biden didn't release Epstein case documents - if indeed they contain any material that could damage Trump's reputation.\nSome of the president's supporters are caught between their desire for more information and possibility of damaging their movement if the story rumbles on.\n\"For 10 years the leftists have been looking for something, anything, to drive as a wedge between Trump and MAGA,\" wrote one TheDonald contributor. \"This has been their most successful attempt yet.\"\nSomeone else shot back: \"Trump made the wedge himself by running his mouth.\"\nRisky strategy for Trump as he escalates Epstein row with loyal supporters\nGabbard says declassified report 'exposes' Obama administration\nJeffrey Epstein\nConspiracy theories\nDonald Trump\nUS politics\nUnited States"

Three left-led French municipalities declared him an \"honorary citizen\".\nThough eligible for parole since 1999, he saw successive requests for liberty turned down. According to supporters, this was because of pressure on the French government from the US and Israel.\nInterviewed recently by the French news agency AFP at his cell in Lannemazan jail, he said he had kept sane by focusing on the Palestinian \"struggle\".\n\"If I had not had that… well, 40 years – it can turn your brain to mush,\" he said.\nOn the walls of his cell, Abdallah kept a picture of the 1960s revolutionary Che Guevara and postcards from supporters around the world. A desk was covered with piles of newspapers.\nAFP\nAbdallah was eventually released from Lannemezan prison in southern France in the early hours of Friday\nBorn in 1951 into a Christian family in northern Lebanon, in the late 1970s Abdallah helped set up the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF) – a small Marxist group dedicated to fighting Israel and its closest ally, the United States.\nAt the time Lebanon was embroiled in a civil war. In 1978 and again in 1982 Israel invaded south Lebanon to combat Palestinian fighters based there.\nAbdallah's group decided to hit Israeli and US targets in Europe, and carried out five attacks in France. In 1982 its members shot and killed US diplomat Charles Ray in Strasbourg, and Israeli diplomat Yakov Barsimantov in Paris. In addition a car bomb blamed on LARF killed two French bomb-disposal experts.\nAbdallah was arrested in Lyon in 1984. Tailed by French intelligence officers, he thought he was being followed by Israeli assassins and gave himself in at a police station. Initially he was charged only with having false passports and criminal association.\nA short time later a French citizen was kidnapped in northern Lebanon, and the French secret service entered a negotiation via Algeria to engineer an exchange.\nThe French citizen was freed, but just before Abdallah was to be released police in Paris found a cache of weapons at his flat, including the gun used to kill the diplomats. This made his release impossible.\nTwo years later in the run up to his trial, Paris was hit by a spate of attacks which killed 13 people. These were blamed by politicians and the media on allies of Abdallah trying to pressurise France into freeing him. Later it was established that in fact they were the work of the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, under instructions from Iran.\nIn the trial, Abdallah denied involvement in the murders but defended their legitimacy. He was given a life sentence.\nGetty Images\nGeorges, seen here between two police officers, was convicted in the 1980s\nOf the more than 10 requests for release since 1999, only one came close to success. But in 2013 then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote to the French government expressing the hope that it could find a \"way to contest the legality\" of a court decision to free Abdallah.\nHer message was later made public by WikiLeaks.\nInterior Minister Manuel Valls then refused to sign the expulsion order on which Abdallah's release was contingent.\nThis year the appeal court decided that the length of Abdallah's detention was \"disproportionate\", and that he no longer posed a threat. It said again that his release must immediately be followed by expulsion from France.\n\"This is a victory for justice, but it is also a political scandal that he was not released before, thanks to the behaviour of the United States and successive French presidents,\" said his lawyer Jean-Louis Chalanset.\nAmong the people who campaigned for his release was the 2022 Nobel literature prize winner Annie Ernaux, who said he was a \"victim of state justice of which France should be ashamed\".\nYves Bonnet, the intelligence chief who tried to negotiate Abdallah's exchange in 1985 and is now a member of the far-right National Rally, said he was \"treated worse than a serial killer\" and that \"the United States was obsessed with keeping him in jail\".\nAccording to a report in Le Monde newspaper, no Palestinian prisoner – even those condemned to life imprisonment in Israel – has served more than 40 years in jail. Abdallah served 41.\nIsrael & the Palestinians\nFrance\nPalestinian territories"

the UK's most visited porn website - and\nsocial media platform Reddit\n.\nRequirements to verify age on Reddit appear to have taken effect across a wide range of its individual, topic-based subreddits, such as those dedicated to discussions about alcohol.\nThe Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Newsbeat the UK's new rules apply \"common sense\" to regulating the internet.\n\"We're very used to proving our age in lots of different areas of life at the moment, and it makes sense that we do so more assertively when it comes to online activity,\" he said.\n\"I think people actually think it's pretty weird that you are age checked when you want to buy a can of Monster, but you're not age checked when you access certain material online.\"\nThe UK's new online safety rules, explained:\nWhat is the Online Safety Act?\nHow could age checks for porn work in the UK?\nFrom Reddit to Pornhub: Which sites will require UK age verification?\nChris Sherwood, chief executive of children's charity the NSPCC, said Friday's new rules mean services \"can no longer evade their duty for protecting children\".\nHe added it was \"high time for tech companies to step up\" and prevent children encountering harmful content on their platforms.\n\"Children, and their parents, must not solely bear the responsibility of keeping themselves safe online,\" he said.\nFor Prof Elena Martellozzo, professor of child sexual exploitation and abuse research at the University of Edinburgh, the rules send a message to the tech industry that \"child safety and child protection are not optional\".\n\"Failing to act is no longer excusable under the guise of technical complexity or business models,\" she added.\n'More to be done'\nNot all believe Ofcom's rules go far enough to protect children as intended, however.\nThe Molly Rose Foundation, a charity founded by the family of Molly Russell - who took her own life at the age of 14 after seeing harmful content online - has said stronger legislation is needed to better protect children.\nAndy Burrows, the charity's chief executive, said Ofcom has prioritised \"the business needs of big tech over children's safety\", with thresholds for requirements and estimated costs for changes falling short of what is needed to force the largest companies to take action.\nDerek Ray-Hill, interim head of the Internet Watch Foundation, meanwhile welcomed the new rules for sites allowing porn but said \"there is still more to be done\".\nHe said platform operators should be considering how to make them safer by design and \"doing everything they can to make sure we are building an internet that is safe for everyone\".\nOthers have have expressed concern that people may seek ways to circumvent so-called age gates on porn sites - potentially pushing them towards less regulated spaces with more dangerous and explicit sexual material.\n\"A lot of the porn out there is incredibly derogative to women and there's a lot of violence and aggression,\" said Reed Amber Thomas-Litman, a sex worker and educator.\n\"Of course people, not just kids or young adults, are going to mimic that.\"\nShe told Newsbeat providing information about porn as part of the sex education curriculum could \"help young adults understand it is a fantasy, it is not reality\".\nAge checks could also negatively impact people who do not feel comfortable sharing their identity, such as LGBTQ+ people, she said.\n\"If you have to hand over your ID, that means you have no protection where that information is going,\" she said.\n\"It could go to third party companies and who knows what they'll do with that information.\"\nMany of the sites which operate age verification services say they do not retain ID, videos or images required for them to carry out age checks for any longer than necessary.\nThe debate: Will the new rules for pornography sites do more harm than good?\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter\nto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.\nOutside the UK?
